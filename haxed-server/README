------------

Intallation
-----------

Download a haxed client - or build your own from http://www.github.com/blackdog66/haxed, to bootstrap a haxed-server from source, follow the instructions in the README in haxed, otherwise ...

To install a haxed-server

1. Run haxed install, to install haxed-server in your haxed repository.

   haxed install haxed-server

2. cd to where you want to create your runtime dir, e.g.

   mkdir server-dir
   cd server-dir

3. Now, generate the haxed-server files from the template you installed in 1.

   haxed build haxed-server

   This 

   a. creates a www directory with the default haxed-server website in www 
   b. compiles haxed-server code to php into the www/lib directory
   c. generates a default nginx configuration
   d. the repository dir is in server-dir/repo, with downloaded zip files served from
      server-dir/repo/__files__

   Please note the default installation is for a git repository - so you need git 
   installed. A sqlite database implementation is also available but I don't use it
   so someone who does can document it.

Configuring you webserver
-------------------------

For the nginx default configuration you need
    
    nginx the latest dev build is fine (you need one with a -p option)
    spawn-fcgi installed (a lighttpd subproject) 
    php-5.3 compiled with a php-cgi
    ports 10000 and 8200 clear 

if this is the case then

   ./start

   should start an nginx instance on port 8200, talking to php slaves on port 10000


Populating Your Repository
--------------------------

To make packages available in your new haxed repository on port 8200

1. Make a new Project

   haxed new

   Tweak the settings of YOUR_NEW_PROJECT.haxed and rename it to your project name.


2. Submit your Package

   haxed submit -R localhost:8200 myproject
